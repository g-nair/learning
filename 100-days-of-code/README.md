## About

Hey there, my name is Gautam Nair. I am currently working as a Data/Biz Analyst.  
My day to day tasks at work are accomplished primarily in SQL and visualization tools such as Google Data Studio.


A couple of years ago, I took an online course on [Python from MITx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) and it opened a lot of doors for me!
I was having a great time learning the material and was excited to find opportunities to apply what I had learned.
Despite getting a new job that was more technically demanding, it proved difficult to find/create projects that would benefit from my newly aquired Python skills.

As a result ... my Python got a little rusty! My SQL is constantly improving, but I am ready to have another tool to reach for in my toolbelt.

## Enter 100 Days of Code

A hashtag I see at least 10x a day whilst scrolling through Twitter, it was time for me to embark on a refresher journey of my own.  
***And so...***

Here is my goal, purpose, and a loose plan on what I hope to do in the 100 days.

### Goal:
To generally refresh on Python and expand my Python/Programming toolkit

### Purpose: 
To make Python something I can utilize more readily, opening up more opportunities to use Python in projects with less lead time.

### How:
- Refreshing on the basics by reading through the first parts of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) and [How to Automate the Boring Things](https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2)
  - I've aquired quite a few textbooks over time, and they felt like great places to restart/reform my foundation
- Diving into specific libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Data Viz tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh
- Getting better aquainted with developer tools like Git/GitHub, PyCharm, and VSCode
- Then into another couple NoStarch books - [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://nostarch.com/beyond-basic-stuff-python) and [Dive Into Algorithms](https://nostarch.com/Dive-Into-Algorithms)
- And lastly, I plan to have a **Final Project** of some sort - that is completely to be determined.

The "rules" of the challenge are basically to document any day that you've coded for one hour+

Doing anything in consecutive days has always been challenging for me, and so I am expecting short gaps. On particularly motivated days, I may even count 2+ hours as two days of the challenge.

If you've made it this far - thank you for your time! I am very open to suggestions/reccomendations, and my progress can be followed either through the [log file](https://github.com/g-nair/learning/blob/master/100-days-of-code/log.md) in this repo
or by following the Twitter account I made specifically for this [@gauthumb_codes](https://twitter.com/gauthumb_codes).
