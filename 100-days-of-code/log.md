# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read through the first six chapters of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) refresing on basics such as
- Variables
- Data Types
- Lists
- if Statements
- and Dictionaries

Some bits and bobs that I hadn't remembered since I did this last were things like
- The difference between `pop()`, `del`, and `remove()` when working with lists
- How beautiful list comprehensions can bring a tear to one's eye
- Using `get()` when working with dictionaries allows you to set a default output if the key you tried to access isn't there
- Sets being an easy way to remove duplicates from a list

I also browsed through the first three chapters of [How to Automate the Boring Things](https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2) which covered similar topics

**Thoughts:**  

If you're fortunate enough to have both of these books, the difference in presentation of the material and the various specifics each author decides to include in their basics sections really does provide a comprehensive refresher on Python syntax/what's possible with core Python.
