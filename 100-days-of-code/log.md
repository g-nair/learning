# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Another few chapters of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) this morning! Topics covered were
- User Input
- while Loops
- Functions

Specifics I was happy to have refreshed:
- the use of while loops to iterate until a list is emptied or no longer contains a specified element through pop/remove
- how to use positional, keyword, and default arguments as appropriate
- dealing with optional arguments, as well as arbitrary (\*args) and arbitrary keyword (\*\*kwargs) arguments
- and lastly, a reminder on how to save files to import modules into main code files

I then decided I would give the [PyBites Intro Code Challenges](https://codechalleng.es/bites/intro) a try.

I made it through the first four challenges and found myself *very* confused by the [fifth challenge](https://codechalleng.es/bites/105/) because of how bizzare the syntax of the function definiton looked: `def slice_and_dice(text: str = TEXT) -> list:`

I had never seen anything like it! I ended up spending way too much time trying to figure out what was happening.  
Thankfully the Python Docs had my back - letting me know to relax... It was just a [Function Annotation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#function-annotations).

Now I know! I did like the platform a lot, I will have to restart from the 5th intro challenge onward.

### Day 1: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read through the first six chapters of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) refresing on basics such as
- Variables
- Data Types
- Lists
- for Loops
- if Statements
- and Dictionaries

Some bits and bobs that I hadn't remembered since I did this last were things like
- The difference between `pop()`, `del`, and `remove()` when working with lists
- How beautiful list comprehensions can bring a tear to one's eye
- Using `get()` when working with dictionaries allows you to set a default output if the key you tried to access isn't there
- Sets being an easy way to remove duplicates from a list

I also browsed through the first three chapters of [How to Automate the Boring Things](https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2) which covered similar topics!

**Thoughts:**  

If you're fortunate enough to have both of these books, the difference in presentation of the material and the various specifics each author decides to include in their basics sections really does provide a comprehensive refresher on Python syntax/what's possible with core Python.
